        digital artwork and oil painting!

              <p >My current project focuses on creating a lightning detection system that is configured to send alerts to Mcity's central server API.
        I am working with AS3935 lightning detectors, using various testing methods to evaluate their capabilities, range, and response values. Future progress
        and steps involve connecting the detector to a Particle board and utilizing its cloud for event storage. I'll also be working in python to store detection 
        information in postgreSQL, develop a triangulation algorithm, and communicate events to to the central server API using websocket communication.
      </p>
      <p >My most recent (nearly) completed project was developing wireless trigger devices for the test facility. There were two triggers in
        particular, one that is button-based and another that is LiDAR-based. I developed printed circuit boards as well as firmware for these devices, and I worked in the Flask
        framework for server interactions. These devices are built on WiFi development boards, the ESP8266 Feather HUZZAH, and communicate 
        in real-time with the central server API through websocket communication. Users can run automated tests through Mcity's frontend, Skyline, and these devices act as trigger statements within such tests.
        These devices are particularly useful in their versatility, and how they improve the particular events users can add to their automated tests in the facility. The button triggers can be shorted with other devices 
        such as traffic trackers to allow for broader uses such as vehicle detection; the LiDAR triggers offer a variety of configurations by the user, and they can act as 'trip wires' with detection up to 40 meters.

        <p >As an intern at DaVita, I was able to gain important skills including evaluating requirements, working with

        I gained experience with the Angular framework, as well as important ideas behind/requirements of frontend development. As I became more comfortable with HTML,
        CSS, and TypeScript, I built a small application as a display of my skills (and a fun way to learn more about something I'm passionate about: the environment!).

        a schematic and printed circuit board for the safety loop of the powertrain, also known as the shutdown circuit. This particular circuit 
        recieves signals from other functional circuits in the accumulator (battery), including the battery management system, brake system plausibility device,
        isolation monitoring device, and e-stop buttons. It interprets these signals to control the accumulator isolation relay, which is essentially the switch 
        that controls the high voltage system. The goal of this circuit is to use latching for security-- to act as a safety measure in response to any other circuit.
